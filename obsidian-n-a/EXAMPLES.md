# Obsidian AI Plugin Examples

This document provides practical examples of how to use the Obsidian AI Plugin in various scenarios.

## Basic Chat Examples

### Example 1: Asking about your notes
```
User: What are the main topics I've been writing about lately?

AI: Based on your recent notes, you've been focusing on several key areas:

1. **Machine Learning & AI**: You have extensive notes on neural networks, deep learning architectures, and recent developments in large language models.

2. **Personal Knowledge Management**: Several notes discuss PKM systems, note-taking methodologies, and tools like Obsidian and Roam Research.

3. **Project Management**: You've documented various project management frameworks including Agile, Scrum, and GTD (Getting Things Done).

4. **Philosophy of Mind**: Recent entries explore consciousness, cognitive science, and the hard problem of consciousness.

5. **Book Reviews**: You've been actively reviewing books on productivity, technology, and philosophy.

The most frequently referenced topics appear to be AI/ML concepts and knowledge management strategies.
```

### Example 2: Research assistance
```
User: I'm writing about the history of artificial intelligence. Can you help me find relevant information from my notes?

AI: I found several relevant sources in your knowledge base about AI history:

**From your notes:**
- "AI Timeline.md" - Contains a comprehensive timeline from 1950s to present
- "Turing Test Origins.md" - Discusses Alan Turing's contributions and the famous test
- "Winter of AI.md" - Covers the AI winters of the 1970s and 1980s

**Key points from your research:**
1. **1950s Foundation**: Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) and the Dartmouth Conference (1956) marked the beginning of AI as a field.

2. **Early Optimism (1950s-1960s)**: Initial breakthroughs in problem-solving programs and the development of LISP programming language.

3. **First AI Winter (1974-1980)**: Funding cuts due to unmet expectations and limitations of early approaches.

4. **Expert Systems Era (1980s)**: Rise of knowledge-based systems and commercial AI applications.

5. **Second AI Winter (Late 1980s-1990s)**: Market collapse of expert systems and reduced interest.

6. **Modern Renaissance (2000s-present)**: Big data, improved algorithms, and computational power leading to current AI boom.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific period or aspect?

   - For reference material: 200-400 characters

2. Embedding Model Selection:
   - Mobile devices: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d, 22MB)
   - Desktop with good specs: all-mpnet-base-v2 (768d, 420MB)

3. Sync Frequency:
   - Active projects: Every 30-60 minutes
   - Stable knowledge base: Every 4-6 hours
   - Archive material: Daily or weekly
```

### Memory Management
```
1. Regular Cleanup:
   - Rebuild embeddings monthly for active vaults
   - Clear chat history periodically
   - Remove unused external integrations

2. Batch Processing:
   - Process notes in groups of 50-100
   - Use auto-sync during off-peak hours
   - Monitor system resources during embedding
```
